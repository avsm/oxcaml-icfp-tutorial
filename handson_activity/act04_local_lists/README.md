# Local lists

In this activity, we will implement `iter` and `map` functions over a list that
operate over stack-allocated data. Your goal is to modify `local_list.ml{i}` so
that `test_local_list.ml` successfuly builds. You should not modify
`test_local_list.ml`.

You can build the test as

```bash
dune build
```

in the current directory. You can run the test as

```bash
dune exec ./test_local_list.exe
```
